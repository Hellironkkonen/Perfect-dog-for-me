# Perfect dog for me

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Dog is man's best friend, but how can one choose a right friend. This solution will help to narrow down options for the right life-long friend.  


## Background

There are numerous different dog breeds. They varies from hunting to family dogs and from petite to giants. 
Dogs are not toys you can throw away if the choise feels wrong. With this solution anyone can input own preferences or a picture of a dog and AI will scan databases for suitable dogs. 



## How is it used?

Interface is very user-friendly application which is available both for android and iOS users. 
Using the solution is fairly simple. You can either take a photo of a dog and the application will automatically fill in all the reguired data such as height, weight, color and breed or you can do it by yourself. Then the application searches through different databases and recommends different breeds to choose from.




## Data sources and AI methods
All data comes from reliable official sources such as Suomen Kennelliitto (The Finnish Kennel Club). 

## Challenges

This solution will give a recommendation of different dogs. However the relationship between a dog and owner can not be solved with any AI.
